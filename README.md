## hp Pavilion 15-be002tx (1st)

hp 15-be002tx was my First ever Machine I had from 2017 to (early) 2020.

> During the Course of this 3 years, I had to replace the Battery, Adapter as well as the Main Hard Drive once costing me almost 12K INR.

Had to give it up due to issues with Screen and aging Processor (I had no issues until I thought about going up a few Generations with my Processor)
